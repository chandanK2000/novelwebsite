                         DataNovel Vision AI uniquely detects, processes, and instantly analyzes visual elements in video streams but does so in nanoseconds, versus the time it takes a human being.

                    <p>
                        We have built the worldâ€™s best Vision AI platform engineered with the finest human qualities capable of deep understanding and the ability to make decisions. The result is a computer vision AI platform that sees, comprehends, and acts like a human, but without error, fatigue, or distraction. We envision a world where humans are free to do the things they do best, and where technology does the things better left to technology.
